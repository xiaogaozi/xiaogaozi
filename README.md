Hi, I'm **xiaogaozi**. I work at [Juicedata](https://juicefs.com), former [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com), [Jike](https://iftech.io), [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com) and [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com) employee. I'm a backend engineer, blogger, geek, guitar player, hobbyist photographer, traveler, indie (sometimes 3A) gamer, automator and full-time dreamer. Not necessarily in that order.

I maintain a (maybe) weekly digest called **"Maybe News"**, if you have interest you could subscribe to it [here](https://digest.xiaogaozi.org/maybe-news).

May the source be with you. ðŸ––
